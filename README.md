# Discord-Bot
This is a node.js bot made for my old discord server with quite a few commands (54 more exactly).

The commands have the next categories:
Informations (ping of a host, userinfo, etc...)
Moderation (ban, kick, lockdown of a channel, purge, set nickname)
Fun (generate a random number, send cat and dogs random images, etc...)

It was write for Discord-Js V11.
